# Codemon

In the hopes of recapturing some passion for games dev I have elected to once again assemble the infamous codemon
Originally build in the year 2011 by myself as a young stary eye highschooler, this is mostly a faffing around project.

Written in python this is a 2d tile based Pokemon Rip.

The mon's are programming languages, the sprites are from deviant art, and the code is hacky

Just as nature intended
